But you can't place...
Make me an offer I don't waste them now...

Are you still right?
What have you learned?
Do for yourself
Take what you can't earn

Do you still rank?
What do you say?
Take in the slack
'Cause baby your little control trip is going away

What were you believing--that I might do okay?
(Do we end up owing something?)
What were you conceiving?
Maybe just that plants and birds and rocks and things could justify my day

He know he got to be good lookin'
He got the crystal blue persuasion
He know the thing that's gonna please ya
He is un chien Andalusian
He got the friend from many stages
He do the police in different voices

Just wanna make a change
Do it a little different
Do it a little different
Different

Stone cold sober, how can I hide?
I can't go to work today
Lord, oh Lord, what have I done?
I wanna dance to the beat of a different drum

Things ain't what they used to be
Makes no difference to me
Your words came through, my time has come
I wanna dance to the beat of a different drum

24 hours in a day
I can't keep going in this way
Got no choice, just got to run and run
Just wanna know I can dream of a rising sun

I will dance to the beat of a different drum
I will dance to the beat of a different drum
I will dance to the beat of a different drum
I will dance to the beat of a different drum

Shade your eyes, it's getting bright
Don't look down, I know you're scared of heights
Bit by bit we'll overcome
(Bit by bit we'll overcome)
I wanna dance to the beat of a different drum

I look around, what do I see?
A thousand faces all staring at me
Lord, oh Lord, what have I done?
Just wanna show what we are, what we will become

I'm gonna dance to the beat of a different drum, drum, drum

I will dance to the beat of a different drum
I will dance to the beat of a different drum
I will dance to the beat of a different drum
I will dance to the beat of a different drum
(Wanna dance to the beat of a different drum)

I'm gonna dance to the beat of a different drum
Drum

Just wanna make a change
Just wanna make a change
Do it a little different
Just wanna make a change
Do it a little different
Than yesterday

Every morning I watch you walk into the office
In your business suit and matching shoes
With your hair pulled up neatly you tug at your glasses
And you sit down just three desks down
And I watch you in the florescent glare
And my mind drifts away somewhere
And I see you In a different light your hair falling down
With love in your eyes, In my mind
You're a beautiful sight, I see you in a different light
Just the way I saw you last night

There's girls at the office the guys always notice
When they walk by, but you're not the type
They don't know what I know or somethings' just don't show
Through tailored tweads, and that's fine with me
Let them all think what they want to As for me when I look at you
I see you In a different light, your hair falling down
With love in your eyes In my mind
You're a beautiful sight, I see you in a different light
Just the way I saw you last night
Baby it's you, In a different light your hair falling down
With love in your eyes, In my mind
You're a beautiful sight, I see you in a different light
Just the way I saw you last night
(Its you)
In a different light, your hair falling down
With love in your eyes, In my mind
You're a beautiful sight, I see you in a different light
Just the way I saw you last night
